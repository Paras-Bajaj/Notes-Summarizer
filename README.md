üõ† Installation & Setup
Clone or download the project files

Ensure you have both index.html and app.py in the same directory

Install Python dependencies

bash
pip install flask flask-cors nltk
Install NLTK data (automatic on first run, but can be manual)

python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Start the Flask server

bash
python app.py
Open the application

Open index.html in your web browser

Or navigate to http://localhost:5000 if serving via Flask

üöÄ Usage
Input Your Text:

Paste or type text directly into the input box

Use the "Load Sample" button for demonstration text

Monitor text quality indicator for optimal results

Configure Settings:

Select your preferred algorithm (Frequency, Position, or Hybrid)

Adjust the summary length slider (1-10 sentences)

Generate Summary:

Click "Generate Summary" to process your text

View the summary with extracted keywords

Examine processing statistics (compression ratio, time, etc.)

Export Results:

Copy to clipboard with one click

Export in TXT, Markdown, or JSON formats

Access previous summaries from the history section

üéØ Technical Details
Summarization Algorithms
Frequency-based: Ranks sentences by word frequency

Position-based: Prioritizes sentences based on their position in the text

Hybrid: Combines frequency and position scoring for optimal results

Text Processing
Advanced natural language processing techniques

Smart keyword extraction with common word filtering

Fallback mechanisms for environments without NLTK

Frontend Technologies
Modern HTML5 with Tailwind CSS for styling

Vanilla JavaScript for interactive functionality

Responsive design principles

Smooth animations and transitions

üåü Benefits
Time-Saving: Quickly extract key information from long texts

Flexibility: Multiple export options for different use cases

Privacy: All processing happens locally - your data never leaves your browser

üêõ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Server Connection Problems:

Ensure Flask server is running (python app.py)

Check that both files are in the same directory

Verify no other applications are using port 5000

Text Processing Issues:

For longer texts, allow additional processing time

Ensure text is in a supported language (primarily optimized for English)
